 # Blogging-System
 


The user and register and make a account by entering their credentials.
The user is then redirected to login upon which they can then make blog-posts.

All the posts and credentials are stored in a mySql database that was created using php and Xampp

The UI was built using HTML and CSS and javascript was used to provide client-side validation.
php was used to built the backend part of the website and connect to the database and also provide server-side validation.

This project is still incomplete and I'm planning to add more features.
